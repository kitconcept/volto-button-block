## Upgrade Guide

### Support for Block Model v3

A new block model it's being developed by the community.
This block model will change some internal structures in the Volto Block Engine.
This add-on is compatible with the Block Model v3 from 3.x series on, via an opt-in flag.
During the 3.x series of this package, the flag will be opt-in.
When the 4.x, the Block Model v3 will be the default for this add-on and the flag will be removed (no opt-out).

```js
config.blocks.blocksConfig.__button.blockModel = 3;
```

### SemanticUI support

The 3.x series will be the last one to support a SemanticUI button.
The 4.x version will support `@plone/components` `Button` component only.

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon volto-fhnw-web25-base
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block`to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start Volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-button-block'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@kitconcept/volto-button-block';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
