## Upgrade Guide

### Support for Block Model v3

A new block model it's being developed by the community.
This block model will change some internal structures in the Volto Block Engine.
The new Block Model v3 will be implemented and supported initially by `@kitconcept/volto-light-theme` in its next major release.
Later on, when it's a reality and it's polished and tested, it might be ported to Volto core.
Read more about the [Block Model v3](https://github.com/kitconcept/volto-light-theme/blob/91039fcab0f7709fd28ea8b8a8f9e7c86291a8dd/BLOCK-MODEL-V3.md).
This add-on is compatible with the Block Model v3 from 3.x series on, via an opt-in flag (`blockModel`).
The flag will be opt-in during the 3.x series of this package.
After 4.x is released, the Block Model v3 will be the default for this add-on and the flag will be removed (no opt-out configuration option will exist).

Example of the usage of the flag:

```js
config.blocks.blocksConfig.__button.blockModel = 3;
```

### SemanticUI support

The 3.x series will be the last one to support a SemanticUI button.
The 4.x version will support `@plone/components` `Button` component only.

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @kitconcept/volto-button-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block`to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start Volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-button-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-button-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-button-block'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@kitconcept/volto-button-block';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
